| '87 - '91 | Augusta,<br>GA         | Born and not much raised. I have a memory of mini-golf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| '91 - '96 | Signal Mountain,<br>TN | Grade school. I had trouble coloring inside the lines (not in a metaphorical way). My dad let me use his computer and I remember playing a lot of [ImagiNation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQDCptBzR64) and [The Incredible Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine_(series)).     |
| '96 - '98 | Baton Rouge,<br>LA     | I had this cool group of neighborhood friends. N64 and PS1 had their heyday. I wasn't the _fastest_ typist in my keyboarding class, but I was the only one who could get Frogger to work during recess, so I had that going for me. The trick was to change the display resolution of the Windows95 host ;)   |
| '98 - '03 | Duxbury,<br>MA         | Computing was more commercially available, and I had the privilege of taking the _AP CS (A)_ curriculum with a TurboC compiler licensed to my high school. I hung out with actors and other such nerds, and I was even in a couple of plays!                                                                  |
| '03 - '05 | Ridgeland,<br>MS       | Finished out high school with proper LAN parties and an independent study in _AP CS (AB)_. Did [Speech and Debate](https://www.speechanddebate.org/). I tried track and field, but after it was clear I couldn't jump very high they had me work the tracking software for runners' stats.                    |
| '05 - '09 | Ithaca,<br>NY          | Got a bachelor's in CS from Cornell. "_What is difficult to endure is sweet to remember._"                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| '09 - now | Bay Area,<br>CA        | Worked at Google for 6 years as a Software Engineer. Then went to Wavefront, leaving after it was acquired by VMWare. Then went to SimpleLegal, leaving after it was acquired by Onit.                                                                                                                        |
